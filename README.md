# MIT_SCRATCH – Visual Coding Platform 🎨

**MIT_SCRATCH** is a block-based visual programming platform inspired by MIT Scratch. This project was developed as part of an assignment for the Juspay Frontend Program using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and modern React features like hooks, context, and dynamic rendering.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🛠️ Features

- 🧩 **Drag and Drop Block Interface**: Users can build logic using blocks like `move`, `turn`, `say`, `goto`, `wait`, `repeat`, etc.
- 🎭 **Multiple Sprites**: Each sprite has its own block workspace and executes independently.
- 🔁 **Play and Animate**: Clicking "Play" executes the blocks in order and updates sprite positions in real time.
- 🧠 **Block Executor Engine**: Handles animation logic (move, turn, loop) with timing and transitions.
- 🖼️ **Stage Panel**: Shows live sprite movement with updated X/Y and rotation.
- 🧩 **Sprite Manager**: Maintains and updates global sprite state.
- 🧩 **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive experience.

## 🧩 How it Works

```txt
[Drag Block] → [SpriteWorkspace.jsx]
             ↓
[Block data saved in spriteManager.jsx]
             ↓
[Click Play] → [ControlPanel.jsx]
             ↓
[executeBlocks(sprite)] → [BlockExecutor.jsx]
             ↓
[x, y, rotation updated] → [setSprites()]
             ↓
[StagePanel.jsx re-renders sprite positions]
